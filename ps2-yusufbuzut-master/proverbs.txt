Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
All for one and one for all
All is fair in love and war
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy 
All is well that ends well
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An apple never falls far from the tree
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Appearances can be deceiving
April showers bring May flowers
Bad news travels fast
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Beggars cannot be choosers
Behind every good man is a good woman
The best defense is a good offense
The best laid plans of mice and men
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts
The bigger they are the harder they fall
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Birds of a feather flock together
Blood is thicker than water
Boys will be boys
Caught between a rock and a hard place
A chain is only a strong as its weakest link
Charity begins at home
The chickens have come home to roost
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Close but no cigar
Cold hands warm heart
The cure is worse than the disease
Curiosity killed the cat
The customer is always right
Damned if you do damned if you do not
Discretion is the better part of valor
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Do not bite off more than you can chew
Do not bite the hand that feeds you
Do not change horses in midstream
Do not count your chickens before they hatch
Do not cry over spilt milk
Do not cut off your nose to spite your face
Do not judge a book by its cover
Do not lock the stable door after the horse is gone
Do not look a gift horse in the mouth
Do not make a mountain out of a mole-hill
Do not put all your eggs in one basket
Do not put the cart before the horse
Do not rock the boat
Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater
Do not upset the apple cart
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
The early bird catches the worm
Easy come easy go
Easy does it
The end justifies the means
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
Every man pays his price
The exception that proves the rule
Experience is the best teacher
Feed a cold starve a fever
Finders keepers losers weepers
First things first
Fish or cut bait
A fool and his money are soon parted
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Give the devil his due
God helps those who help themselves
Going to hell in a handbasket
Good fences make good neighbors
Good men are hard to find
Great minds think alike
Good things come in small packages
Good things come to he who waits
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
Great oaks from little acorns grow
Half a loaf is better than none
Haste makes waste
Here today gone tomorrow
He who hesitates is lost
He who laughs last laughs best
He who lives by the sword dies by the sword
Hindsight is 20-20
His bark is worse than his bite
Honesty is the best policy
Honey catches more flies than vinegar
A house is not a home
Idle minds are the devils workshop
If at first you do not succeed try again
If God had meant us to fly he would have given us wings
If it is not one thing it is another
If the shoe fits wear it
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
If you cannot stand the heat get out of the kitchen
If you want a thing done right do it yourself
Ignorance is bliss
Immitation is the sicerest form of flattery
In for a penny in for a pound
Into every life a little rain must fall
It is better to give than to receive
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
A jack of all trades is master of none
Keep your powder dry
Keeping up with the Jonses
Kill two birds with one stone
Laugh and the world laughs with you
Laughter is the best medicine
Leave well enough alone
A leopard cannot change its spots
Let bygones be bygones
Let sleeping dogs lie
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like father like son
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
Little strokes fell great oaks
Live and learn
Live and let live
Look before you leap
Love is blind
Make hay while the sun shines
Man does not live by bread alone
Many hands make light work
Measure twice cut once
Misery loves company
A miss is as good as a mile
Money does not grow on trees
Money is the root of all evil
Monkey see monkey do
The more the merrier
Necessity is the mother of invention
It is not over untill it is over
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today 
Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you
It is never too late to change
No news is good news
No pain no gain 
No rest for the weary
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Oil and water do not mix
Old habits die hard
Once bitten twice shy
One good turn deserves another
One picture is worth a thousand words
One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Out of sight out of mind
The pen is mightier than the sword
A penny saved is a penny earned
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
A place for everything and everything in its place
Possession is nine-tenths of the law
Practice makes perfect
Practice what you preach
Pride comes before a fall
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
Put up or shut up
Put your money where your mouth is
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Rome was not built in a day
Rules were meant to be broken
Scratch my back and I will scratch yours
Seeing is believing
The show must go on
Silence is golden
Slow and steady wins the race
Spare the rod spoil the child
Speak softly and carry a big stick
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me  
Still waters run deep
A stitch in time saves nine
Strike while the iron is hot
Talk is cheap
There is a sucker born every minute
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no accounting for tastes
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no honor among thieves
There is no place like home
There is no time like the present
They do not make things like they used to
Time heals all wounds
To err is human to forgive divine
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Turnabout is fair play
Two heads are better than one
Two is company three is a crowd
Two wrongs do not make a right
Up a creek without a paddle
Waste not want not
A watched pot never boils
Well begun is half done
What goes around comes around
Whatever will be will be
What you see is what you get
When it rains it pours
When in Rome do as the Romans do
When the cat is away the mice will play
When one door closes another door opens
When the going gets tough the tough get going
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is smoke there is fire
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink
You cannot please everyone
You cannot take it with you
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You get what you pay for
You cannot win them all
You have to break a few eggs to make an omlette
You have to take the good with the bad
You win some you lose some
